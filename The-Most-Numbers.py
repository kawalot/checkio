#Determine the difference between the smallest and the biggest numbers.
#You are given an array of numbers (floats). 
#You should find the difference between the maximum and minimum element. 
#Your function should be able to handle an undefined amount of arguments. 
#For an empty argument list, the function should return 0.
#Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions. 
#So we should check the result with Â±0.001 precision.
#Think about how to work with an arbitrary number of arguments.
#Input: An arbitrary number of arguments as numbers (int, float).
#Output: The difference between maximum and minimum as a number (int, float).
